I tested this package with SpaceInvaders's ROM image.
I contracte with Taito Corp to use the ROM image for education purposes.
Therefore, I cannot include the image in this package,
instead the ROM image file 'midway.mem' consists of infinit loop instruction.
You can write your original games for this platform, and place the image
in HEX format in 'midway.mem' to play.

Also this package requires at least a non-profit license for NSL Core.
You can get one from http://www.overtone.co.jp/
